## Current Projects

### 🐱 Cat Breath Monitor 
I've developed a user-friendly iOS app for monitoring feline heart health through measuring and recording breathing rates. Available now on the App Store as of December 2024!

### 🤖 Upcoming Android Development 
I'm currently working on the Android version of the Cat Breath Monitor, hopefully launching it on the Google Play Store in Winter/Spring 2025. *Stay tuned for more updates!* 💻
